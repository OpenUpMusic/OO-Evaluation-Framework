When you ask participants the questions, we suggest keeping it light and informal! Avoid asking questions at the end of a music session - somewhere in the midst of music making often works well. If participants are not in a position to give a clear answer, please select ‘not sure’ and then add a comment to clarify.

When you submit each survey you will be emailed a copy of the responses for your records.
