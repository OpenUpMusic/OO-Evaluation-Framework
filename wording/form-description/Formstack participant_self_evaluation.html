<p><strong>Before you start...</strong></p>

<p>Please ask each participant to answer the questions below. (You'll need to complete one survey per participant.)</p>

<p>When you ask participants the questions, we suggest keeping it light and informal! We have found that asking questions somewhere in the midst of music making works a lot better than at the end of a music session. If participants are not in a position to give a clear answer, please select 'not sure' and then add a comment to clarify.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> You need to complete this survey in one go as nothing gets submitted until you click <strong>Submit</strong> at the end.</p>
