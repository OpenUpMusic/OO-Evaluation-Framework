<p><strong>Before you start...</strong></p>

<p>Please ask each participant to answer the questions below. (You'll need to complete one questionnaire per participant.)</p>

<p><span data-key="51"><span data-offset-key="51:0">When you ask the questions, we suggest keeping it light and informal! Avoid asking questions at the end of a session - somewhere in the midst of music making often works well. If participants are not in a position to give a clear answer, please select 'not sure' and then add a comment to clarify.</span></span>
</p>

<p><span data-key="51"><span data-offset-key="51:0">Thank you!</span></span>
