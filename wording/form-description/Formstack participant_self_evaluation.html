<p><strong>Before you start...</strong></p>

<p>Please ask each participant to answer the questions below. (You'll need to complete one survey per participant.)</p>

<p>We fully appreciate that Open Orchestras participants have a wide range of communication and/or learning difficulties. You will need to present these questions in an appropriate manner for each individual. If participants are not in a position to give a clear or definitive answer, please select 'not sure' and then add a comment to clarify.</p>

<p>When you ask participants these questions we suggest keeping it light, informal and avoid putting them on the spot! We have found that asking questions somewhere in the midst of music making works a lot better than at the end of a music session.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
